  title: Realistic Image Synthesis
  description: |
    The first part of this course presents modern mathematical models of lighting and shading, and the numerical methods and algorithms needed to solve them and generate beautiful realistic images. Afterwards, we explore how these methods can be adapted and applied to modern machine learning-based problems. Technical content will be delivered using a combination of in-class lectures, tutorial/lab sessions, and (optional) supplemental reading. Learning objectives will be solidified and evaluated through coding assignments in Python (relying heavily on careful vectorization with <code>numpy</code> and <code>Jax</code>).

  title: Fundamentals of Computer Animation
  description: |
    This course will provide an introduction to computational techniques for generating animation. Topics will include methods which have applications in the creation of movie effects, the development of video games, and training simulations. While the focus will largely be on physically based methods for the automatic generation of motion, part of the course will cover methods for user control of animation and reuse of captured motion data. The main objective of this course is to have students develop an understanding of fundamental techniques used for computer animation.
